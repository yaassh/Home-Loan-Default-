# Introduction
In this project, weâ€™ll be focusing on a specific type of risk called Credit or Default Risk, which has both systemic and unsystemic drivers. The main point is that the drivers of default risk can be measured and analyzed for patterns related to default. As a result, the probability of default for a person or an institution is not random. This is where machine learning can help.

# About the company
Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

# Challenge
While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
