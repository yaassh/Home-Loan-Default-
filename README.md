# Home-Loan-Default-
In this project, weâ€™ll be focusing on a specific type of risk called Credit or Default Risk, which has both systemic and unsystemic drivers. The main point is that the drivers of default risk can be measured and analyzed for patterns related to default. As a result, the probability of default for a person or an institution is not random. This is where machine learning can help.
